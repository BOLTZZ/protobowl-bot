Uses Selenium and [QuizDB](https://www.quizdb.org) to reverse lookup answers and buzz in first line. It's not the greatest but I don't really care enough to make it better.

P.S. anyone that wants to use this has to figure out how to run this. I'm not gonna help little kids try to be the coolest kid on their team. If you can get this working then it's fair game for you to use it imo have fun
